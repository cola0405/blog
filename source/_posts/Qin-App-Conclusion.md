1.API document

Make a standard document of the request and response

So that the Client and Server side can be isolated

You can write your code as you like, but just follow the API document

---

2.Modified API document

The first version of API document may not be so perfect

As the work beginning, we will found that the API document should be modified

But don't worry, if you do enough job in the first version of API document

It's not a big deal

---

3.How to deal with API document

For my team, we first step is to work out a flow chart according to our requirement 

With a basic flow chart, we can figure out the data we need

Then we talk about the data base structure

After these work, we can almost formulate the API

---

4.Trouble with API document

Even though my team make a API document

But sometimes, my teammate still do not follow the document

Even though I make a comment there 

But still miss that 

Ah..

Then I meet with some strange bugs because of the wrong data I received

5.Refactor and Lifecycle In Android

It's a funny thing that the most of time I spend is not for implement the function

It's for refactor

Oh..

Maybe my experience is not enough, not so familiar with Android and Kotlin

I wrote some repeat code for Student-side and Teacher-side

Actually, some repeat codes can be integrate into a util class

And that's the problem, I spend a lot of time when I am doing integration

Almost every time I integrate the codes, the app will breakdown  

Because I am not familiar with the lifecycle of Android 

```
The lifecycle is really important in Android
```

My teacher say it a long time ago, but I miss it

Oh..

I didn't pay much attention to lifecycle of Activity

That make a lot problems

And I use Fragment also, I still not familiar with the lifecycle with Fragment

They comes together ! ! 

And that's why I almost go crazy when I deal with the bugs

---

6.Record

I got a good habit when working with this project

That is record ! 

I record the bugs I meet, and put them in a file named "Bugs waiting to solve"

And after I fix it I will commit in git and record the solution of it in another file named "Bugs"

With these file I really feel I learn something from this project

---

7.Github

This is the first time I use Github work with a team (actually there are just 2 people in my team haha)

Github is so cool ! ! 

You can see every commits

You can see how many codes you have wrote

When merge the code, you can easily deal with the conflict

Perfect ! !

And ssh key is important

With ssh key you can push you code directly,

Don't need to input the username and password again and again

---

8.Git

With git, you don't need to worry missing your code you just wrote

Every time after you fix a bug or implement a function commit it to git !

---

9.Android Document

See official document ! !

Please ! ! 

That's the most correct way to solve the problem

The other important thing is "Use you brain"

Do not just follow the solutions other people provided

That solutions just give us advices

You need to learn from that

Not just follow that

And what's more, pay you all attention to the Note!

Every "Note" in document is pretty important ! !

---

10.How to use a new function

When you meet with unfamiliar function and don't know how to use it 

And you can't find it's document (not official module)

You can go to see it's source code

Maybe you can got you answer there

Don't be afraid of source code

Generally, the source code is clean code

And they are easily to read ~
