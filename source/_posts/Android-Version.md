The API version and Android version are different

API version is Android SDK version

It's usually for developer

Developer need Android SDK when making App

And different SDK version will have usage, developer need to check the relative document

And Android version is usually for user

Like we can check our Android version of our mobile phone

Generally, Android version is associated with SDK version

example:

| API Level | Android Version |      |      |
| --------- | --------------- | ---- | ---- |
| 30        | 11              |      |      |
| 29        | 10              |      |      |
| 28        | 9               |      |      |
| 27        | 8.1             |      |      |
| 26        | 8.0             |      |      |

If you use lower version of API to write an App

It will have better compatibility

But you can't use the new feature of the SDK

It depends on you

Haha
